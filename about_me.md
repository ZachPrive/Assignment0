**Major**: Finished Psychology and then added a CS Minor. I guess you could call me a senior.

**Interesting thing about me**: I was born in Montreal, Canada. My first language was french. Also I competed in gymnastics for a large portion of my life, now I focus on CS and moving on to getting a software engineering job (hopefully UI).
